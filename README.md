"I developed a full-stack project leveraging modern technologies: on the frontend, I utilized React with ShadeCDN and Vite for efficient module loading. On the backend, I implemented a robust solution using Spring Boot, Maven, and REST APIs. Seamless integration between frontend and backend was achieved through Redux, ensuring efficient state management and a cohesive user experience."
